# Gilded Glitch Portfolio Platform

## 🎯 Product Vision

An avant-garde portfolio platform that transforms chaotic cyber-brutalism into elegant Art Deco design through scroll-based animations, positioning designers as artists who bring order to digital chaos.

## ❓ Problem Statement

Designers need a portfolio platform that showcases their unique aesthetic vision and ability to transform complex, chaotic concepts into polished, elegant solutions. Traditional portfolio sites lack the visual storytelling and interactive elements necessary to demonstrate this transformation skill.

## 🎯 Goals

- Create an immersive portfolio experience that visually represents the designer's transformation philosophy
- Implement smooth scroll-based animations that transition from brutalist to Art Deco aesthetics
- Develop a custom cursor interaction system that enhances the 'repair tool' metaphor
- Showcase case studies through interactive, animated storytelling

## 🚫 Non-Goals

- Support for multiple user accounts or designer profiles
- Content management system for non-technical users
- Real-time collaboration features
- Mobile-specific responsive design optimization

## 👥 Target Users
